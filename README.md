# Sketchers-Consumer-Segment-Marketing
Acting as product managers at Sketchers, we analyze the company's current US target market and propose a new consumer segment—based on non-demographic segmentation—to grow Sketchers' market share. Our Marketing Pitch is attached above.

The project includes:
- An overview of Sketchers’ existing target segment and their current 4Ps marketing strategy.
- A detailed proposal targeting a new, distinct consumer segment with research-backed rationale.
- A creative ad campaign tailored specifically for this new segment.
- Strategic recommendations covering product, price, place, and promotion tailored to the new market.
